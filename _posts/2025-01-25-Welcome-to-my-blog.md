I have no idea what I am doing, but I want to learn how to create a personal finance website. I want to start with tracking account balances on all assets and liabilities manually. Then I want to make the accounts pull in an automated manner (Probably using Plaid API). Then I want to focus on adding transactions. Followed by a budget feature. Add in retirement/goal planning, and education.
